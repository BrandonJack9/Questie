## Signatures

### Format

The signatures must be added by creating a git commit, which adds a single line to the end of the list below, containing the git config settings `user.name` and `user.email` in the following format:

```md
* `UserName <UserEmail>`
```

Ideally the commit should be created using gits `user.Signingkey` feature, so it will show as verified. This can be done by creating the commit directly through GitHubs website.
