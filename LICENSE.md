# Licensing

## Note to contributors

If you are considering contributing to Questie please be aware that submitting pull requests after TODO_ADD_MERGE_DATE requires consent for licensing your contribution under the terms of the contributor license agreement found in the `CLA.md` file, in the form of a git commit adding your git identity to the list.

If you are a former contributor please consider adding your name to the list there, or giving us consent to do so for you through an issue or a Discord message.

If you are a former contributor and feel any of the things discussed here are infringing on your copyrights please contact us through the aformentioned means.

## Third party software licensing

The files in the `Libs` directory are third-party-software and their individual licenses apply. See the `Libs/LICENSE.md` file for more information.

## Other licensing

The priority of licensing information is as follows:

1. License information inside an individual file
2. LICENSE.md file inside a subdirectory
3. This LICENSE.md file in the root directory

## Questie's licensing

### All rights reserved disclaimer

Because Questie historically never had a license the situation is inconsistent and it is unlikely the Questie Team will be able to gather consent from all the, at the time of writing, 110 historic contributors for a re-licensing.

So when in doubt you should consider Questie as "all rights reserved".

That being said, we consider historic contributions made in the spirit of open source development until we hear otherwise. And although of course we cannot make that statement on behalf of all individual former contributors, to the best of our knowledge it holds true for all of them as well.

### Retroactive licensing

In an effort to clear the licensing situation up the Questie Team will try to gain as much consent as possible for relicensing under open source licenses from past and future contributors, so that hopefully a majority of the project can eventuall be covered in the future.

The project will default to the MIT license, and to the CC0 license where the former is not applicable.

For a copy of the MIT license see the `Licenses/MIT.txt` file.

For a copy of the CC0 license see the `Licenses/cc0-1.0.txt` file.

For a list of licensors and licenses, or to add your signature, see the `CLA.md` file.
